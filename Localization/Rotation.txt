Rotation:

1. Problem: ambiguity in orientation matrixes. Final orientation stays the same - so not really a problem

Note, there is always more than one sequence of rotations about the three principle axes that results in the same orientation of an object, eg. see [Slabaugh]. Returned tree rotation matrices and corresponding three Euler angules are only one of the possible solutions.

2. Rodrigues vs. Euler? 
Rodrigues: Vector+rotation
Euler: three angles.
