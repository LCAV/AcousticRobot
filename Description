Experimental setup of sound emitting and processing robot for acoustic based SLAM applications:
- Development of image processing and computer vision algorithm for 3D localization of robot using object to image space correspondences and triangulation, including setup of webcams.
- Control of robot movement and localization using odometry. 
- Recording of room impulse response used in acoustic based SLAM algorithm. 
- Integration of visual, acoustic and odometric data in a comprehensive framework for experiments comparing the precision of different localization algorithms. 

Deliverables:
- Framework for above mentioned experiment
- Comprehensive documentation for use of the framework
- Experimental data
- Project report
