CSE Project I (8 Credits)
Frederike Dümbgen

Laboratory of Audiovisual Communications (LCAV)

Experimental setup of sound emitting and processing robot for acoustic based SLAM applications.
Development of image processing and computer vision algorithm for 3D localization of robot using object to image space correspondences and triangulation
Integration of acoustic and visual data to create comprehensive framework for experiments including robot movement control, robot localization using cameras and recodring of room impulse response. Comparison of precision of odometry, acoustic and visual localization.

Deliverables:
- Framework for above mentionned experiment
- Comprehensive documentation for use of the framework
- Experimental data§
- Project report
