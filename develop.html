<h3> Robot </h3>
<p>For a better functioning of the robot, a changement has been made in the source code of the server. 
A line was added to the function stop_drive_motors()  so that when the robot is at rest, its motors are shut down. 
Without doing so, the motors sometimes entered some unstable state where they were making a loud noise after receiving the command to stop.
The resulting code with highlighted inserted line was:

In order to compile it,...

<h3> How to create backup of SD Card (Mac) </h3>

<p>Insert the SD card into your computer and open a Terminal. 
Find out the number of the inserted disk by typing </p>
<code>diskutil list</code>

<p> In the following, the SD card is assumed to have number 2. 
Unmount the SD card by typing <code>diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk2</code>. 
Now you may copy the image to your desired location by typing: </p>
<code>sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 bs=2m | gzip > ~/Desktop/backups/backup_robot.gz</code>
<p> or, directly zipping the file: </p>
<code>sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 bs=2m | gzip > ~/Desktop/backups/backup_robot.gz</code>

<p> When the backup is needed, it can be unzipped by entering 
<code> sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 bs=2m | gzip > ~/Desktop/backups/backup_robot.gz </code>. 
Once the image is unzipped, the card where the backups is to be copied to can be
inserted and unmounted as described above and then the image can be copied onto it using 
</p>
<code> sudo dd if=~/Desktop/backups/backup_robot.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=2m </code>
