As both the number of robots and the range of their application areas grow, so too does the need for autonomous navigation systems that allow robots to not only map their surroundings, but also localize themselves relative to surrounding objects. 
One approach to such a system is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
The idea behind SLAM is \ldots
In this project, a method of implementing SLAM using visual localization is tested experimentally. The experimental setup consists of four cameras fixed at \ldots\ldots\ldots\ldots
